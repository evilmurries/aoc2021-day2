AOC 2021 day 2 in Kotlin

## Some Notes
It turns out I do not remember as much Kotlin as I thought I did, primarily the extension functions.
For that reason I am using AOC to refresh my memory. These solutions are often hardly optimized, and 
fail to take advantage of many features that would make for a more concise solution. Any tip + tricks 
on improving would be greatly apprecated. I often find myself reaching into java brain and doing things
in an OOP and procedural style when it is not the most efficient way. Thank you.
